ONC/RPC for Windows NT
----------------------

Version 1.14.3

Welcome to the ONC/RPC package for Windows NT (and also for
Windows 95/98). This Version is based on Martin Gergeleit's
famous ONC/RPC package (last official version 1.11).

Unfortunately, Martin Gergeleit doesn't actively maintain the package
any longer and has shut down his web pages, so the Chair of Process
Control Engineering (of Aachen University of Technology) now hosts the
ONC/RPC package.

But first a message from our lawers:
