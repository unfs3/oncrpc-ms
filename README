ONC/RPC for Microsoft Windows
=============================

 oncrpc-ms is yet another port of Suns "Open Network Computing Remote
 Procedure Call" (ONC/RPC) for Microsoft Windows. This port is based on
 the ACPLT implementation, which is based on Martin Gergeleit's package,
 which is based on Suns "RPCSRC 4.0". This project, though, features
 public repository access and MinGW support. Support for Visual C++ .NET
 2003 is also planned. The goal for this project is to become the de
 facto standard ONC RPC implementation for Microsoft Windows. Please
 note that ONC RPC does not support IPv6. If you need this, take a look
 at the libtirpc project (a Windows port is yet to be done).

Here's a small FAQ:

Q: There are already several ONC/RPC implementations for Windows
   available. Why yet another fork?

A: All implementations that I've found are poorly maintained. The thing
   that disturbes me most is the lack of version control. For me, it's
   just not sufficient to put up a onrpc.zip file on the web. I want bug
   tracker, version control, mailing etc.

Installation
------------

When choosing the "Custom" setup type, only select the "Portmap NT
Service" for installation when installing on a Windows NT machine.
Although this package can also be selected on Windows 95/98/01 systems,
the installation will then fail.

The "Typical" setup type installs the binary files, the ONC/RPC DLL and
the header files, so you can also develop ONC/RPC applications.

If you only want to install the ONC/RPC DLL then choose the "Compact"
setup type.

To install the source code of the ONC/RPC package, you need to choose
the "Custom" setup type and then manually select the source code
package.
